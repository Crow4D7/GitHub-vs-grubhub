# GitHub-vs-grubhub
this is a factual opinion. anyone that disagrees is wrong lmao

So basically, github is far better than grubhub. This is because the numebrs between the 2. Grubhub reported about 33 million active userss. Github reported near 100 million. This is all i have about this, but I was recently in a conversation with some friends and they were syaing grubhub is better. But also you rarely even see people use Grubhub. It died after the meme lmao.
